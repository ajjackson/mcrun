# mcrun
Framework for material chemistry calculations

For now this is a personal project to help manage my research.  The
idea is to elisp, org-mode and an sqlite3 database to create a fast,
searchable and largely automated workflow for reproducible research.

Currently the code is in the form of snippets in the **mcrun.org**
document. At some point this should become a literate source for the
production code.
